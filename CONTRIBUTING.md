## Code of Conduct
        
By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold my [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/omznc/slashy/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  
## Getting Started
    
Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:
  * Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
  * For any security related issues, please contact me directly at [security@omarzunic.com](mailto:security@omarzunic.com).

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with Slashy, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Please include as much detail as possible in your report/suggestion.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
Basically, just:

  1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
  2. Test your code.
  3. Make a pull request.

## Getting Help

You can contact me on Discord(Kez#6673) or via [slashy@omarzunic.com](mailto:slashy@omarzunic.com).
