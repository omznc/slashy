### The Localization Update 1 - 18. Apr, 2022

- Renamed some cogs, made it nice and cute.
- Added support for command localization.
  - These only work on slashy's commands (`/slashy add`, `/slashy edit` etc.)
  - English and Croatian are the only ones supported right now.
  - As of the release of this update, Discord hasn't fully released localisation to everyone.
  - You can help translate the commands to your own (discord-supported) language by editing `localizations.json`.
- Changine from development to production mode is as simple as changing a boolean in `main.py`.
- Added an extra logging option in `main.py` that prints out any command modification.
- Moved all error handling to a separate cog.
  - Also sends the error to whoever's ID is set as the `OWNER_ID` in `config.json`
- Updated aiomysql to 0.1.0, and cryptography to 36.0.1
- Fixed some uneccessary imports.

### The Commands Update - 17. Feb, 2022

- Moved all commands under the `/slashy` category.
  - Every non-custom command now starts with `/slashy`, e.g. `/slashy add`
  - This made it so you can use names like `help`, `list` and such as your custom command names.
- Added `/slashy config` so you can set a permission level to use the bot.
  - The command is `Administrator`-only and will stay that way.
  - If you want me to add any other permissions, open an issue.
- Redone some of the cog organization. This shouldn't concern end-users, just makes my life easier.
- Fixed SQL injection... lol.
- Probably introduced new bugs. Time will tell.
- New logo, that's cool I guess.

### The Cleaner Code Update - 13. Feb, 2022

- Added placeholder support:

  - Things like `[[user]]`, `[[server.member_count]]` and such.
  - Read up below.

- Updated Novus to latest Github build, which in turn allowed me to do the following:
  - Added auto-completion support for command names when using /edit and /remove.
  - No longer using raw HTTP requests to manage your commands.
- Cleaned up a lot of unnecessary code.
