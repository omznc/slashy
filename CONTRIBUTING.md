## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold
my [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/omznc/slashy/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* For any security related issues, please contact me directly
  at [security@omarzunic.com](mailto:security@omarzunic.com).

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with Slashy, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR
is created. Please include as much detail as possible in your report/suggestion.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
Basically, just:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Test your code.
3. Make a pull request.

## Getting Help
