## Hey, I'm Slashy - your friendly neighborhood custom-command bot!

The code for this bot exists because I like the open-source community, so feel free to run it yourself, or submit pull requests to improve it.

You can get help on using the bot with the `/slashy help` command in any of the servers Slashy is in, or in Slashy's DM-s.

## Invite

Click [right here](https://hey.imkez.com/slashy-invite) to add Slashy to your server.

## Documentation, information, license, self-hosting & contributing

You can find everything mentioned on [Slashy's website](https://slashy.omarzunic.com/).

## Notes

You might notice a python branch. That's the old version of this bot and it's no longer maintained. I'm keeping it there for archival purposes.

Ephemeral means that the reply can only be seen by the person who originally ran the command.
